##How to import external data in R

The packages needed in this script are the following:
'''r
library(terra) # managing raster and vector data
library(imagery) # analysing RS data
'''

In order to import data in R we should set the working directory:

'''r
library(terra)
setwd("~/Dowloads/")
'''

To check for the folder you can make use of:
'''r
getwd()
'''

The import of the data is done by:
'''r
group <- rast("image.JPG")
'''

If you receive errors, check that the path is correct and that the image is inside the folder you...

To get info on the image, digit its name by:
'''r
group
'''



In order to plot the image we will use the RGB scheme:
'''r
# layer 1 = red wavelenght, layer 2 = green wavelenght, layer 3 = blue wavelenght
